# COSC140 homework 3

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?

 * I spent a lot of time on this homework. I was able to complete most of the URL checker independently, but I was struggling with some of the more complex functions for the requirements (such as counting colons or checking if port is or isn't present). I came into office hours for help with this homework before I submitted it.

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?

Professor Sommers helped me greatly with the Ghost problem and with debugging the URL checker. The functions were not hard to write for Ghost and I understand why I needed to use what I wrote. I just need more practice writing functions and loops and I will be okay with them.
